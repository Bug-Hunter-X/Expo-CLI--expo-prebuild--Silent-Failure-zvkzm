This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project. The issue is related to the `expo prebuild` command, which is used to prepare the project before building it for different platforms.  The error message may not be explicit, but it often manifests as a build failure or an unexpected termination of the `expo prebuild` process without clear indication of what went wrong. This is often due to unexpected problems within node modules or the project's configuration files. It's often hard to debug directly due to the lack of a helpful error message, requiring an in-depth review of the project's setup and dependencies.
