The solution involves a methodical approach to debugging. There's no single fix, as the root cause can vary.

1. **Clean your project:** `expo prebuild --clean` can sometimes resolve temporary issues.
2. **Check your package.json:**  Look for conflicting dependencies. Try updating or removing packages one by one to isolate the problem.
3. **Examine your app.json (or expo.json):** Ensure your configuration is correct and valid.  Typos or incorrect settings can lead to silent failures.
4. **Check your native modules:** If you're using custom native modules, ensure they are correctly configured and compatible with your Expo version.
5. **Simplify your project:** Create a minimal reproducible example. If possible, start a new project and gradually add components from your original project until you identify the problematic element.
6. **Check the Expo CLI version:** Make sure you're using the latest stable version of the Expo CLI. Run `expo update` to update.
7. **Examine the logs:** Even without a clear error message, carefully examine the entire output of the `expo prebuild` command in your terminal. Look for hints or warnings.  It is recommended that you use a logging framework like Winston to debug such issues.
8. **Search for similar issues:**  Search on the Expo forums and GitHub issues for reports of similar problems. This often helps identify patterns and solutions.  If you canâ€™t find a solution, please submit a new issue.
