# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-diagnose issue with the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command.  The problem manifests as a silent failure â€“ the command exits without providing a clear error message, making debugging challenging.

## Problem

The `expo prebuild` command is crucial for preparing your Expo project before building it for various platforms. When this command fails silently, it blocks the entire build process, leaving developers without clear clues on how to fix the problem.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully examining your project's dependencies and configuration files. This often requires a systematic approach to identify the source of the problem.  Check for conflicting dependencies, incorrect configurations, or issues within custom native modules.
